        "As we were unable to cover this topic in lectures the aim of this coursework will be to code up a moving average model. The concept behind this model involves comparing the short term moving average (e.g average over the last 5 days) with a long term moving average (e.g average over the last 200 days) at each time point. This comparison is what produces buy/sell signals.\n",
        "****\n",
        "### Strategy Outline\n",
        "This strategy has 2 parameters. \n",
        "- **s** - the lookback period for calculating the moving average over a **short** time period.\n",
        "- **l** - the lookback period for calculating the moving average over a **large** time period.\n",
        "\n",
        "At each time instance it is necessary to calculate the simple moving average of the previous **s** and **l** asset prices. To do this in code you could for example do ***self.data[\"Adj Close\"][c][i-s:i].mean()*** i,e calculate the mean of the previous s values at time step i for stock code or ticker c.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then if the short moving average crosses the long moving average i.e the value of the **small time period MA is greater than the large time period MA** then this is a **buy** signal. Otherwise enter a neutral position. (for this strategy there will be **no short selling**) \n",
        "\n",
        "For an individual security at a ceratin time point a buy signal corresponds to a positive value in self.strat and a neutral postion corresponds to a 0. Remember to also normalize across each row of self.strat as was done in the time series momentum strategy in lecture 1.\n",
        "****\n",
        "### Extension\n",
        "An optional part of the coursework will be to extend the complexity of the strategy. You are free to investigate or develop any extra code that you like although I will include a few examples of how to extend the above model:\n",
        "- Instead of using simple moving average's try to code **exponential moving averages** or attempt to use **Kauffmann's adoptive moving average**. For more info on this check out https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/kaufmans-adaptive-moving-average-kama/\n",
        "- Implement a **weighting scheme**.\n",
        "- Investigate how **varying the parameters** of the number of days used in calculating moving averages effects returns and/or volatilty. Try discussing how you would tune the parameters in the question.\n",

        "\n",
        "The 20 marks for the basic strategy will be awarded for the following:\n",
        "- Getting something that works as described above **(10 marks)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Usage of **Pandas and Numpy** to optimise how the code runs. For example there are lots of useful inbuilt pandas and numpy functions that can make your code considerably shorter and easier to follow including ***pd.rolling(), pd.pct_change()*** to name a couple. The following 2 links are for the pandas and numpy documentation repsectively, https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ and https://numpy.org/doc/ **(5 marks)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Readability of the code and efficiency. Try to include a few comments although don't go overboard. **(3 marks)**\n",
